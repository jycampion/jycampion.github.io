This clinical presentation has been referred as “long COVID.” We here present a retrospective analysis of 18F-FDG brain PET of long COVID patients from the same center with a biologically confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and persistent functional complaints at least 3 weeks after the initial infection. Methods PET scans of 35 patients with long COVID were compared using whole-brain voxel-based analysis to a local database of 44 healthy subjects controlled for age and sex to characterize cerebral hypometabolism. The individual relevance of this metabolic profile was evaluated to classify patients and healthy subjects. Finally, the PET abnormalities were exploratory compared with the patients’ characteristics and functional complaints. Results In comparison to healthy subjects, patients with long COVID exhibited bilateral hypometabolism in the bilateral rectal/orbital gyrus, including the olfactory gyrus; the right temporal lobe, including the amygdala and the hippocampus, extending to the right thalamus; the bilateral pons/medulla brainstem; the bilateral cerebellum (p-voxel ","tags":["18F-FDG, PET, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, Anosmia, Stress, Complaints, Memory, Fatigue, Angiotensin-converting enzyme, Long COVID, Dysautonomia"],"title":"18 F-FDG brain PET hypometabolism in patients with long COVID","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicolas De Leiris","Berangère Ruel","Jean Vervandier","José Boucraut","Stephan Grimaldi","Tatiana Horowitz","Jean Pelletier","Frederique Fluchere","Jacques-Yves Campion","Elsa Kaphan"," others"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643895242,"objectID":"1a3742d1d0825dd9db9faaeab3bb42f1","permalink":"https://jycampion.github.io/publication/de-2021-decrease/","publishdate":"2022-02-03T13:34:23.121814Z","relpermalink":"/publication/de-2021-decrease/","section":"publication","summary":"Purpose: The aim of this [18F]-FDG PET study was to determine the diagnostic value of the cortex/striatum metabolic ratio in a large cohort of patients suffering from autoimmune encephalitis (AE) and to search for correlations with the course of the disease.

We seek to determine the relationship between peripheral inflammation and brain SPECT perfusion in stabilized antipsychotic-treated outpatients with schizophrenia, and to determine whether such perfusion changes are correlated with persistent symptoms. Methods: Highly sensitive C-reactive protein blood level (hs-CRP) and brain SPECT perfusion were assessed in 137 stabilized outpatients with schizophrenia. Whole-brain voxel-based associations were searched with SPM between SPECT perfusion and hs-CRP (correlation analysis to quantitative levels and between-group analysis according to a threshold of 3 mg/L). The identified clusters were secondarily correlated with clinical symptoms. Results: After adjustment for age, sex, educational level, illness duration, antidepressant use, chlorpromazine equivalent dose, tobacco smoking and obesity, a negative correlation was found between hs-CRP level and the perfusion of 4 brain areas: the right inferior frontal gyrus, the right middle/superior temporal gyrus, the left superior parietal lobe, and the right postcentral/transverse temporal gyrus (p-voxel 80, uncorrected).
